The PG-rated film was filmed in Alcorn County, Mississippi and the Bounds and Oakland Community of Itawamba County, Mississippi. Though released in 1972, it saw limited runs in the U.S. until re-released about ten years later. The opening courthouse scenes of Tomorrow were shot at the historic Jacinto Courthouse in Alcorn County, Mississippi. The courthouse, built in 1854, has been refurbished and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The majority of the movie was filmed in the Bounds Community of Itawamba County, at the sawmill on the Chester Russell farm. Russell was the grandfather of singer Tammy Wynette (Virginia Wynette Pugh), whose father died when she was nine months old. Wynette lived most of her young years with her grandparents on their farm, until she married in 1960. The sawmill building, where much of the movie was shot, was built just for the movie. Chester Russell was one of the jury and can be seen when the jury is deliberating in the opening courthouse scenes. Lead actor Robert Duvall calls Tomorrow one of his personal favorites of all the films he's done."

The film stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis as three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis co-star as a client and her neighbor, and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters' first recruit. Aykroyd conceived the film as a project for himself and fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus John Belushi, with the ""Ghostmashers"" travelling through time and space in the future with magic wands. He and Ramis dramatically rewrote the script following Belushi's death and after Reitman deemed Aykroyd's initial vision financially impractical. Ghostbusters was released in the United States on June 8, 1984. It received a positive response from critics and audiences and grossed $242 million in the United States and more than $295 million worldwide. It was nominated for two Oscars at the 57th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Song (for the eponymous theme song), but lost to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Woman in Red respectively. The American Film Institute ranked Ghostbusters 28th in its AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list of film comedies. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". The film launched the Ghostbusters media franchise, which includes a 1989 sequel, Ghostbusters II, two animated television series, The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters and several video games. A reboot, also titled Ghostbusters, was released on July 15, 2016, by Columbia Pictures."
