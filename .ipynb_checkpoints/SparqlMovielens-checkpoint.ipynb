The addition of an entirely fictional heroic German officer to the ship\\'s crew was intended to demonstrate the superior bravery and selflessness of German men as compared to the British officers. The film\\'s original director, Herbert Selpin, was arrested during production after speaking out against the Nazi regime – he was later found hanged in prison – and the film was completed by Werner Klingler, who was not credited. Although the film had a brief theatrical run in parts of German-occupied Europe starting in November 1943, it was not shown within Germany by order of Goebbels, who feared that it would weaken the German citizenry\\'s morale instead of improving it. Goebbels later banned the playing of the film entirely, and it did not have a second run.
